# 366 Project 2
 
Group Members: Alex Zelewski (azale2), Moiz Qureshi (mqure6)

Contribution: 
- Alex:
   - Refined and troubleshooted base implementation of Fiboncaci sequence function (1A)
   - Troubleshooted implementation of Odd&Division functions (1B)
- Moiz:
   - Created repository
   - Used pseudocode provided to create a reference .c file
   - Created base code of Fiboncaci sequence function (1A).
   - Created base code of Odd&Division functions (1B)

How to Run:
- FibonacciCalc.asm: The current implementation simply uses an immediate value for the "n'th" sequence number to calculate (see line 5). This immediate value can be adjusted to different integer values, then assembled and run within the MARS simulator.
- Odd&Division.asm: The current implementation loads an immediate value to $t0 as a placeholder function for grabbing the number calculated by FibonacciCalc (see line 20). This value may be adjusted to different integer values, then assembled and run within the MARS simulator.
