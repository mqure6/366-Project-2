# 366 Project 2
 
Group Members: Alex Zelewski (azale2), Moiz Qureshi (mqure6)

Contribution: 
- Alex: Refined and troubleshooted base implementation of Fiboncaci sequence function
- Moiz: Created repository, used pseudocode provided to make a reference .c file, created based code of Fiboncaci sequence function (1A).
  
Repository Link: https://github.com/mqure6/366-Project-2.git

How to Run:
- The current implementation simply uses an immediate value for the "n'th" sequence number to calculate (see line 5 of FibonacciCalc.asm). This immediate value can be adjusted to different integer values, then assembled and run within the MARS simulator.
